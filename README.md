# complex-mapping-pulsar-synth

This work presents a novel digital musical instrument designed to investigate human-instrument control dynamics and the interdependent relationships between touch-based input gestures and pulsar synthesis parameters. It is self contained device, built around the Bela embedded computing platform, it uses capacitive touch sensing as a means of interfacing with the parameters of a pulsar synthesis engine in an effort to encourage a collaborative relationship between performer and instrument that moves beyond traditional notions of transparent, obedient tools.
